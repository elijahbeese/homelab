## ⚡ What This Is

This is not a homelab for running Plex. This is a full-spectrum offensive and defensive security environment built to simulate enterprise attack scenarios, develop real detection engineering skills, and prepare for a career in cybersecurity. Every component was chosen, configured, and broken at least twice.

Built on a mix of repurposed enterprise hardware and consumer gear — because that's what real labs look like.

## 🏗️ Stack

### 🔴 OptiPlex — Local Hypervisor

**Proxmox VE 9.1.1** — Bare metal hypervisor. Hosts all local VMs. Type 1 hypervisor on repurposed desktop hardware.

**OPNsense** `VM 200 · 192.168.1.1` — Virtual firewall and router. Full NAT, DHCP, DNS forwarding via Unbound → Pi-hole. Segments the lab subnet from the apartment network.

**Kali Linux** `VM 100 · 192.168.1.100` — Primary attack platform. Full offensive toolkit. Splunk Universal Forwarder installed, shipping 40,000+ events to SIEM.

**Splunk Enterprise 10.2.1** `VM 101 · 192.168.1.103` — SIEM. Ingesting logs from Kali and the ProBook via Universal Forwarder on port 9997.

---

### 🟠 ProLiant — Remote Heavy-Lift Node

Dual-socket Xeon server co-located in Iowa. Accessed exclusively via Tailscale.

**Wazuh** *(deploying)* — Full stack HIDS: manager + OpenSearch indexer + dashboard. Previously failed on OptiPlex due to spinning HDD I/O timeouts killing OpenSearch initialization. The ProLiant's SAS drives and 32GB RAM handle it properly.

**Windows Server 2022 AD Lab** *(planned)* — Domain controller + Windows 10/11 victim VMs. Attack scenarios:
- BloodHound enumeration
- Kerberoasting
- Pass-the-Hash
- DCSync
- Detection in Wazuh + Splunk

---

Fresh Fedora 43 install. Full-disk LUKS encryption. This is the daily driver for operating the lab.

**OS:** Fedora 43 · LUKS encrypted · i7-1165G7 · 16GB RAM · 475GB NVMe  
**Shell:** zsh + Oh My Zsh + Powerlevel10k + autosuggestions + syntax highlighting

### 🟢 Raspberry Pi 5 — Perimeter Node

**Pi-hole** — Network DNS sinkhole. Every lab DNS query flows through it. Malware C2 beaconing shows up here before anything else catches it.

**Zeek 8.1.1** — Passive network traffic analysis on `eth0`. Structured logs for connections, DNS, HTTP, SSL, and file transfers. Deployed outside the OPNsense perimeter for an independent vantage point.

---

## 🛠️ Tool Usage Reference

### SSH — One-Command Node Access

```bash
ssh proxmox     # OptiPlex hypervisor
ssh proliant    # Iowa ProLiant
ssh pi          # Raspberry Pi 5
ssh kali        # Kali attack VM
ssh splunk      # Splunk SIEM VM
```

All connections route over Tailscale. Passwordless via ED25519 key auth.

### tmux — Session Management

Prefix key: `Ctrl+a`

| Binding | Action |
|---|---|
| `Ctrl+a \|` | Split vertical |
| `Ctrl+a -` | Split horizontal |
| `Ctrl+a z` | Zoom pane fullscreen |
| `Ctrl+a d` | Detach session |
| Mouse click | Switch panes |

```bash
tmuxinator start lab    # Launch full lab layout
                        # windows: local · proxmox · pi · logs
```

---

### Metasploit

```bash
msfconsole

# Inside msf:
search <module>
use <path>
show options
set RHOSTS <target>
set LHOST <your IP>
run
```

---

### Recon Workflow

```bash
# Network discovery
nmap -sV -p- 192.168.1.0/24

# Web directory fuzzing
gobuster dir -u http://target -w ~/tools/SecLists/Discovery/Web-Content/common.txt
ffuf -u http://target/FUZZ -w ~/tools/SecLists/Discovery/Web-Content/common.txt -fc 404

# Credential attacks
hydra -l admin -P ~/tools/SecLists/Passwords/Common-Credentials/10k-most-common.txt ssh://target

# Web scanning
nikto -h http://target
```

---

### Ansible — Lab Automation

```bash
# Ping all nodes
ansible all -i ~/lab/ansible/inventory -m ping --private-key ~/.ssh/id_ed25519

# Run command on all nodes

## 💀 Lessons Learned (The Hard Way)

**Spinning HDDs will kill OpenSearch.** The Wazuh installer has hardcoded initialization timeouts. On a spinning disk, OpenSearch never becomes healthy in time. Eight documented failure modes before accepting this. SSD is a non-negotiable prerequisite.

**Memory ballooning starves Java workloads.** Proxmox's balloon driver dynamically restricts VM RAM. OpenSearch and Splunk need their full allocation at startup — disable ballooning or watch them OOM silently.

**Apartment NAT kills WireGuard.** Inbound UDP is blocked at the upstream router. Tailscale punches through via outbound-only connections. Use it from day one — don't waste time on WireGuard in a NAT'd environment.

**OPNsense and pfSense dropped ARM64.** The Pi can't run either. Run the firewall as a Proxmox VM instead — better performance, easier snapshots, correct architecture.

**You can't configure a live USB.** Fedora's live environment is a RAM-based OS. Nothing persists on reboot. Install to disk before touching anything.

**Wildcard installs will bite you.** A failed `curl` that saves an XML error page as `.rpm` will silently break `rpm -i *.rpm`. Always verify what's in the directory before installing.

**Never type passwords into a chat window.** Just don't.

**Document every failure.** Each one is a lesson that compounds.
